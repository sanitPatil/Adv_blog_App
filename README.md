# Advanced BlogApp with Appwrite

## Description

This project is a continuation of the blog app I started while learning React. It's an enhanced version of the previous blog app, utilizing Zustand for component-level state management. Additionally, TanStack Query (React Query) is used to optimize API calls, providing efficient caching, fetching, and updating of data.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- **User Profile Management**: Manage user profiles with authentication and authorization using Appwrite services.
- **Global State Management with Zustand**: Efficient global state management using Zustand, enabling seamless updates and shared state across components.
- **Server-Side State Management with React Query:** React Query handles server-side data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updating efficiently.

1. **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. **Appwrite**: Backend server for web and mobile developers.
